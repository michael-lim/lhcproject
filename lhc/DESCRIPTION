Description: In an economic landscape, there are many local minima and maxima. While it is very hard to find the absolute maxima of the landscape, it is entirely possible to find many local maxima using the local hill climbing methods. The three methods entail: 1. steepest ascent, in which we look around the neighbors and move to the neighboring point with a maximum profit value, 2. median ascent in which we choose the median of the neighboring points with greater profit value, and 3. least ascent in which we choose the minimum profit value higher than the current profit value. It turns out that in many cases the least ascent has the most potential to optimize the given profit.
